## Project Description
This project provides a set of utilities for parsing text using the Walkman library. It includes three main components: _impl.py, __init__.py, and setup.py.

`_impl.py`: This module includes several classes and functions that are essential for text parsing using the Walkman library. It defines WalkmanException, ParsingError, Location, LocationArea, and Source classes.

`__init__.py`: This module serves as the initialization file for the Walkman library. It imports important elements from _impl.py and provides a high-level interface for users.

`setup.py`: This file is used for packaging and distributing the Walkman library. It includes metadata about the project, such as the author, description, version, and license information.
